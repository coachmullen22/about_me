      <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
      <p>My professional dream is to earn a comfortable living (enough to raise a family) performing work that either helps people maximize their potential, or helps them to stabilize their lives in the face of adversity. I want to be part of a cohesive team that takes pride in their effectiveness and usefulness.</p>

        <li>"Luck is where preparation meets opportunity" -Cicero</li>
